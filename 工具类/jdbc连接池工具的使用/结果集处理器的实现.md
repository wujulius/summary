# 装饰类的使用：
    wrapper是一个接口类： 
    The wrapper pattern is employed by many JDBC driver
    多被应用于JDBC驱动器的加载
    The wrapper pattern is employed by many JDBC driver implementations to provide extensions beyond the traditional JDBC API that are specific to a data source. Developers may wish to gain access to these resources that are wrapped (the delegates) as proxy class instances representing the the actual resources. This interface describes a standard mechanism to access these wrapped resources represented by their proxy, to permit direct access to the resource delegates.

    接口和接口之间通过继承来增强父类的接口，而不需重写父类的方法
    就如同
    ResultSetMetaData继承Wrapper一样
# ResultSetMetaData接口：  
    An object that can be used to get information about the types and properties of the columns in a ResultSet object. The following code fragment creates the ResultSet object rs, creates the ResultSetMetaData object rsmd, and uses rsmd to find out how many columns rs has and whether the first column in rs can be used in a WHERE clause.
# BeanInfo接口：
    用来处理javaBean对象的属性和参数
    Use the BeanInfo interface to create a BeanInfo class and provide explicit information about the methods, properties, events, and other features of your beans.
# Introspector类：
    是一个工具类用来获取一个javaBean对象的具体属性和参数
    The Introspector class provides a standard way for tools to learn about the properties, events, and methods supported by a target Java Bean.
